# Description of What's in my Git-Practice Repository
## What is this?
This is a README. A README is a description of what's in the Repository. It's like when you go to the library and get a box out of the archives. The box will have a description of what's in it to help you research. That's what a README is. It's a short description of what's in your Repository. This can be useful for you (to help remember what's in it) or it could be useful for someone else who is interested in your research and wants to know what's in the Repository before combing through it.
## What's in the Respository?  
This Repository is a folder I made for practice during the GC Digital Research Initiative January 2019 class. It contains a made up syllabus that deals with some ideas I want to explore further in my next class.
